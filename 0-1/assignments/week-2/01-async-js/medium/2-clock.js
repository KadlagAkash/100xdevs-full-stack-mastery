/*
  Clock:
  Utilizing either `1-counter.js` or `2-counter.js` from the easy section, your task is to construct a clock displaying the current machine time. Ensure it updates every second and presents the time in the following formats:
    - HH:MM:SS (e.g., 13:45:23)
    - HH:MM:SS AM/PM (e.g., 01:45:23 PM)  
*/

/*
  We can Implementate clock in Multiple Ways:
  Choose the approach that best fits your requirements and coding preferences.

  1. Using custom updateClock() function:
    - Custom function for formatting time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

  2. Using toLocaleTimeString():
    - Utilizes the toLocaleTimeString() method for convenient locale-based time formatting.

  3. Using Intl.DateTimeFormat():
    - Implements the Intl.DateTimeFormat API for fine-grained control over time formatting.

  Note: Each approach has its advantages; consider factors like simplicity, localization needs, and customization.
