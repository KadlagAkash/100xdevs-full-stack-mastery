/*
  Task: Concurrent Promise Execution Time

  Objective:
  - Write three different functions, wait1, wait2, and wait3, each returning a promise resolving after t1, t2, and t3 seconds, respectively.
  - Create a function, calculateTime, that utilizes these three functions to wait for all three promises to resolve using Promise.all.
  - Return a promise that provides the total time in milliseconds it takes to complete the entire operation.
*/

const wait1 = (t) => {
	
};

const wait2 = (t) => {
	
};

const wait3 = (t) => {
	
};

const calculateTime = (t1, t2, t3) => {
	
};

module.exports = calculateTime;
