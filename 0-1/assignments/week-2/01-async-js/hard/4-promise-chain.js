/*
  Task: Sequential Promise Execution Time

  Objective:
  - Write three functions, wait1, wait2, and wait3, that return promises resolving after t1, t2, and t3 seconds respectively.
  - Create a function, calculateTime, that sequentially calls all three functions in order.
  - Return a promise chain that calculates and returns the time in milliseconds it takes to complete the entire operation.
  - Optionally, compare the results with those from 3-promise-all.js.
*/

const wait2 = (t) => {
	
};

const wait3 = (t) => {
	
};

const calculateTime = (t1, t2, t3) => {
	
}
