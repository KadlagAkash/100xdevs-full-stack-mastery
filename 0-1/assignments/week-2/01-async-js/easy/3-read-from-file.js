/*
  Task: Reading File Contents

  Objective:
  - Write code to read the contents of a file and print it to the console using the fs library as a black box. 
  - Understand asynchronous tasks.
  - Experiment with incorporating an expensive operation below the file read to observe its impact on the output. 
  - Gradually increase the complexity of the expensive operation to analyze its effects on the overall output.
